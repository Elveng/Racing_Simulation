# Race Car Simulation Project

Welcome to the Race Car Simulation project! This README provides an overview of the project, installation and usage instructions, and additional details to help you understand and run the simulation successfully.

## Project Description

This project is a simulation of a race track with different types of vehicles: cars, motorcycles, and formula cars. Each vehicle type has unique attributes and performance characteristics. The simulation demonstrates how these vehicles perform on a race track before and after tuning.

## Installation

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/race-car-simulation.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd race-car-simulation
   ```
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   ```sh
   g++ main.cpp -o race_simulation
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the simulation using the following command:
```sh
./race_simulation
```

### Simulation Output

The simulation will display the following information:
1. Race track details including total length and distance segments.
2. Vehicle performance details before and after tuning.
3. Time taken by each vehicle to complete the track before and after tuning.

### Example Output
